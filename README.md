TJ-MonoPix DAQ

#### Important information 
1) /tjmonopix/tjmonopix_mio_v2.bit is a new bitstream that contains the changes in data order - serializer count. However more changes must be made to the firmware e.g. use both A and B I/O.
2) a method called default_conf was added to tjmonopix.py. When called it sets all the registers of CONF_SR to default. (Would it be better if we added the default values at tjmonopix.yaml to read them from there?)

## TODO - PENDING LIST

2) Implement function to read back the configuration (SO_CONF) to check if it is corrupted. This should be the first test after the power-on test of the chip

3) Read data also from input B. Now only data can be read from the first flavor (A). A and B can be connected with jumpers to flavors 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 respectivelly.
	note: The first readout test should be done with flavor 2 (PMOS) because in theory it is more stable.

4) In line #159 of tjmono_data_rx_core: if (RST_SYNC | CONF_EXPOSURE_TIME_RST) //TODO this is not right. What does this mean? is it important?



## FIRST TEST PROCEDURE
1) In a board without the chip, check jumper positions, voltages and currents with the MIO and GPAC connected and on.

2) Power-on test of the chip (no power shorts - normal electrical behavior)
```bash
ATTENTION: Because of the modified process and HR, latchups can occur during power-on if not done correctly. First, a good connection to PWELL and PSUB is required. Put a very small resistance also to PSUB. Second, the current limit on the presision power supply should not be very small because during power up, the potential of the wells inside the chip can fluctuate and latchup can occur. So give a current limit to e.g. 100mA. the actual steady current will be in the order of Î¼A. It is safer to first power on VDDA and then the other power domains. Correct procedure: A) program the mio, power on the gpac, set DEF_CONF_N to 0. B) Power on VDDA, VDDP, VDDA_DAC, VDDD C) reset the matrix logic and bcid and provide the clocks from the mio.
```

3) Shift in, shift out and confirm configuration is not corrupted

4) Disable all columns, enable test pattern and send READ pulse (or enable columns and inject, but it is better to send a READ PULSE independently of the matrix HIT token), check that the test pattern is received.

5) Inject a row and column of the second flavor and check if we get the correct data
